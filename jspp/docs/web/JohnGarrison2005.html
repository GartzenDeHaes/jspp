<b>Jan 2005 - Present:<br>
Web Development Supervisor</b>
<p>
I currently supervise 11 developers and manage internet application development.

</p>
<b>Oct 2003 - Jan 2005: <br>
Financial Systems Supervisor, Department of Revenue</b>
<p>
Supervised 8 developers and managed several projects. These included 
interagency payments for excise tax returns, property tax receivables re-write, and 
internet payment of invoices. Typical roles I performed were setting priorities with 
managers, communicating project status, gathering and documenting requirements, 
developing project schedules, and assigning tasks to developers.  I also coded and
led developers in VB6 client/server and ASP.NET projects.

</p>

<b>Apr 2002 - Oct 2003: <br>
Internet Excise Tax Return Technical Lead, Department of Revenue</b>
<p>
During this period, the number of application users increased to over 50,000 
with over $300 million a month in payments. This was due in large part to the reliability, 
performance, and usability enhancements which I designed and led.

<dir>
<li>Led three developers in converting 60,000 lines of ASP and VB6 MTS code 
to C# and ASP DOT NET.  Designed a new database schema to support a 
data-driven application model.  Created over 100 unit tests with NUnit.  
</li><br>&nbsp;
<li>

Designed and implemented a multithreaded batch program management server in C#.  Running as 
an NT service, jobs are loaded and ran from dot net DLL's, which can be updated at runtime.
An ASP dot net web application is used to set job schedules, view run history, start or kill
jobs, and to view exception and control reports.  This provides for centralized management
of the batch environment.

</li><br>&nbsp;
<li>
Redesigned and implemented a critical batch program for sending ACH Debit payments to 
US Bank over an unreliable dialup connection with xmodem.  The system provides fully 
traceable audit of creation, sending, send errors, receipt, resending, and deletion of 
payments.

</li>

<b>Jan 99 - Apr 2002: <br>
Internet Excise Tax Return Middle Tier Lead, Department of Revenue</b>
<p>
Redesigned the system architecture and implemented the VB MTS middle-tier and SQL 
Server 7.0 stored procedure changes for a hundred-fold performance improvement in 
Washington State's internet tax filing application.  The original system used an 
ActiveX control in a frame to hold the application data.  Web pages were displayed 
in a separate frame with the data filled in from the control.  It took up to ten minutes 
for a user on a dialup connection to load the main page.  In the redesigned application, 
load time was reduced to ten seconds by keeping the data in the database and 
building the pages on the server with ASP.  After these improvements were made, 
the number of users increased from 200 to 10,000 in less than 18 months.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Used C++ and ATL to create a COM wrapper for DES encryption code.  The COM object was 
used in VB6 projects.

<b>Mar 1997 - Jan 99: <br>
Scientific Application Developer, Department of Ecology</b>
<p>
Developed and maintained a client/server scientific database system using VB, DAO, and Jet.  
Implemented statistical analysis functions and reports.  Wrote a GUI query tool that 
automatically generates table joins from tables, fields, and criteria specified by the 
user. Optimized system performance.
</p>
<p>
Designed and implemented an ActiveX control in VC++/ATL for displaying maps on web 
pages and in applications.  Users may zoom, pan, and select features.  Wrote a web 
page that allows users to select sediment sample locations and view the associated data.
