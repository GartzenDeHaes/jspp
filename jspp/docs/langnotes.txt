1.  Static references must always use the "classname::" prefix.

2.  Arrays use the x[1,2,3] syntax and are block (not ragged) 
format.  A maximum of ten dimensions are supported.  Construct 
an array as follows:

	var x = new array(1,1);
	x[0,0] = "hi";
	
	if ( 1 != array.length(1) )
	{
		// there's a bug
	}

3.  All statement blocks must be delimited by curly brackes.  So,

	if (x) console::print("hi");

is NOT legal.  You must use:

	if (x) { console::print("hi"); }
