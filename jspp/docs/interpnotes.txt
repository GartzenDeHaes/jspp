JSPP Interpreter Notes

- The interpeter is a typical stack based system with commands for
automatic stack frame handling, try/catch, continue, and break.

- qinterp is not reentrant, however I beleive all of it's functions are.
So, if you have multiple threads, you'll need multiple struct qinterp's.

- The call stack frame isn't efficiently implemented.

- The implementation of the various types of method calls have lots of
redundant code (construct, base call, static call, instance call).
