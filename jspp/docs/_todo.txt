-1.  Improve true/false handling.  Allow object::toString(true) to print "true".

0.  Improve null implementation?

1.  Write more native methods

2.  Enforce/implement const.

3.  Enforce access modifiers

4.  Improve / complete String.

5.  Add more tests for complex derefernce instructions such as a.b[x].c.

6.  Improve / complete DateTime.

7.  Implement intrinsic TimeSpan.

8.  Modify hashtable to use a dynamicaly set table size (default is 701).

9.  Fix the compiler to handle forward references.

10.  

11.  

12.  

13.  

14.  Native fields aren't implemented.  Maybe an additional type 
could be added to variant for native data.

15.  "Probably" both fields and methods need to be promoted to data types.

16.  BUG: Referencing a static field with out :: doen't produce a compile 
time error.

17.  The compiler can't tell when static fields or methods are referenced
without using "classname::".

18.  OP_ASSIGN doesn't leave a value on the stack, so expressions like
"var x = y = 1;" don't work.  See test compTest5().

19.  Eliminate duplicate strings from constant data (just needs a 
hashatble).

20.  Add out-of-memory checks to debug.c.

21.  Add heap size restrictions to debug.c to allow testing of low 
memory conditions.

22.  Support passing command line parameters to scripts.
