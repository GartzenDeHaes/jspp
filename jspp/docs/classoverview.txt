JSPP Class Description

Here's  a conceptual description of the main JSPP classes.


QInterp

	This is the interpreter core.  It does not support stepping,
	break points, nor time-slicing.

Program

	Program compiles source code and holds the byte code.  Compile error
	number and line number is held by Program.  Note that the compiler
	quits after any error.

JSClass

	JSClass is a class definition created by Program during compilation.
	It has definitions (VarDef's) for all static and instance fields as
	well as compiled methods.  At runtime, JSClass holds a classes' 
	static data.

JSMethod

	JSMethod is a compiled definition of a method and its arguments.

NativeMethod

	Physically, NativeMethods are held by JSMethod using NATIVEMETHOD and
	NATIVEDESTRUCTOR typedefs.  Native methods run in their own stack and
	block frames and should push their return value.  They also have
	access to the full stack and context.

JSInstance

	Instance of a JSClass.  These are placed on the stack after a NEW instruction.

VarDef

	VarDef is used by the compiler's symbol table, by classes to define
	fields, and by methods to define parameters.

Variant

	Variant is the only data type and is represented by the Variant class.
