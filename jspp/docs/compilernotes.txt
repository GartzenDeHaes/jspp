1.  The compliler doesn't handle forward references (sometimes).  So,
	
	class X
	{
		public XY()
		{
			return m_xy;
		}
		
		private var m_xy;
		
	}
	
won't compile.  But this will compile:

	class X
	{
		public static main()
		{
			var cls = new X();
			X.call1();
		}

		public call1()
		{
			return 1;
		}		
	}

2.  The "leaf" ends of the grammar are not well implmented.  These
include the dot operator, unary operators, and function calls.

3.  Assignment handling is a mess.  There are about 4 different places
in the parser that handle assignments.
