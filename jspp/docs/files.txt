JSPP Files and Directories

mainishere.c:  main.  The command line is
	
	jspp ([-t] | [-d filename] filename).
	
	To run the unit tests: jspp -t
	To disassemble a file: jspp -d outfilename infilename
	To run a program: jspp filename
	
unittest.c: the top level unit test entry point.  Uses testcompile.c.
	
support directory

	This directory contains common data structures and functions 
	such as	string, hashtable, and debug support.  Many of these
	objects are not fully reentrant.
	
suport/test directory

	Unit test for support.  supporttestharness.c is the entry point.
	
grammar directory

	Parser code.  There's obsolete ".l" and ".y" files here too.  I
	decided not to use yacc and lex due to yacc code's lack of 
	reentrancy and poor interface.  
	
interp directory

	This directory contains the interpreter and test files.  
	interpinner.c is the core execution loop.
